Simple Linear Regression

Objectives
* Use scikit-learn to implement simple linear regression
* Create, train, and test a linear regression model on real data

Useing a fuel consumption dataset, FuelConsumption.csv, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.
Dataset source: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64

The task: to create a simple linear regression model from one of these features to predict CO2 emissions of unobserved cars based on that feature.
